## The Problem

You want to write tests for your Solid components so that they avoid including implementation
details, and are maintainable in the long run.

## The Solution

The Solid Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing Solid components. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

## Installation

This module is distributed via npm which is bundled with node and should be installed
as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev solid-testing-library
```
If you using Jest we recommend using [solid-jest](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-jest) to properly resolve the browser version of Solid as Jest will default to the server version when run in Node.

ðŸ’¡ You may also be interested in installing `@testing-library/jest-dom` so you can use
[the custom jest matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom).
